## Project Description
The topic for our project is Population. This is an interesting topic as everything relates to population and we wanted to deep dive into some aspects related to the population in Amsterdam. We were looking around the datasets available and realized it would be great to be able to make analysis comparing the different neighborhoods ofr Amsterdam.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The question we would like to answer is: What would be the best neighborhood in Amsterdam to move in for a young family of 2 parents and 2 small kids?Best neighborhood being defined for the purpose of this analysis, strictly in terms of smallest ratio of felonies per population. think in terms of area safety. 
We did not have a hypotheses before looking at the data, due to not having enough prior knowledge about Amsterdam. 

## Dataset
We used the following datasets:
2020 Household types split per neighborhood
2020 total population male/female split per neighborhood
2018 felonies per neighborhood, split per felony type
All raw data stored on Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1fPJm91F0gBqNM8s9lf7s5NQWeQDltr5D) 
Datasets taken from OIS - Onderzoek, Informatie en Statistiek https://data.amsterdam.nl/

## Database
The database is made up of 3 tables, 1 for each of the datasets. 
The tables are linked on Foreign Key by neighborhood names.
The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWH5Ygm2hIJxvgiS1zD4XGi5nhx6ituJ/view?usp=sharing)
